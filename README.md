# Neural-network-from-scratch

This code is based on the idea from Samson Zhang and his youtube video (https://youtu.be/w8yWXqWQYmU?si=84GMJdX_9kyv3SuW).

The goal is to build a neural network from scratch, without using for e.g Tensorflow, only numpy and basic algebra. This neural network aims to be used to classify hand written digits from the well known MNIST dataset and the math and structure of the network is designed accordingly
